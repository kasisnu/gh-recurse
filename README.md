# gh-recurse


This does nothing too useful and doesn't do anything you couldn't do with some bash-foo. It downloads all repositories under a github organisation with one command.

It was a fun way to revise some Golang and pass time while waiting for a long download to finish.

Have fun on your first day at work.


ex,

  ```
  gh-recurse github


  gh-recurse --help
  ```
